ðŸ”Œ LED Blinking on Arduino
This Arduino sketch blinks two LEDs connected to digital pins 12 and 13.
Each LED turns on and off with a delay of 100 milliseconds, creating a simple alternating blink pattern.
Perfect for beginners learning digital output and timing using digitalWrite() and delay().
Upload the code to your Arduino board and watch the LEDs blink in sequence!
Make sure LEDs are connected with current-limiting resistors to avoid damage.
